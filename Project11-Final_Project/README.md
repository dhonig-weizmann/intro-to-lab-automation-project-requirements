# Project 11 - Final Project 

## Goals
1. integrate the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to develop a final project that encompasses all the concepts learned.
2. Learn about the accelerometer sensor and how to use it in a project.
3. Learn about the OLED display and Buzzer effector and how to use them in a project.

## Setup
1. Use the setup from Project10-Fan_Speed and add the following components:
    - Accelerometer sensor
    - OLED display
    - Buzzer effector
    - connect the servo motor to the board
2. There are two options for packages: Use the grove packages as recommended in the [Grove documentation](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/#hardware-overview), or use the [Arduino SensorKit](https://sensorkit.arduino.cc/) library (this includes all the hardware in the kit).

## Requirements
Build a system that: 
1. changes the angle of the servo motor based on the accelerometer sensor readings.
2. displays the angle in the OLED display and buzzer state.
3. if the angle exceeds a certain threshold, the buzzer should sound.
4. log the time since program start, the angle (in degrees) and the buzzer state in a csv file.
4. Record a video of the system and add to the README below
5. develop a GUI that displays the angle in a graph or compass and the buzzer state as a LED in real-time and logs the data in a csv file.
6. Record a new video that also shows the GUI and add to the readme below

## Exercises
1. paste here the screenshot of the GUI that shows the angle of the servo motor, the buzzer state, and the accelerometer sensor readings in real-time.
2. paste an picture of the OLED display that shows the angle of the servo motor.
3. add the csv file to the project
4. add a video of the system in action
5. If you have multiple folders, write here which is the final version:
